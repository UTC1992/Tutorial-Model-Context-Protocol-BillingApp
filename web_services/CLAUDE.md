# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Environment

This is a Python web services project with a virtual environment already set up.

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Deactivate virtual environment  
deactivate
```

### Python Version
The project uses Python 3.13 as configured in the virtual environment.

## Project Structure

This appears to be a new web services project for invoice control/management. The project structure will likely evolve to include:
- API endpoints for invoice operations
- Database models and migrations
- Business logic for invoice processing
- Authentication and authorization
- Configuration management

## Development Workflow

Since this is a new project, common development commands will need to be established as the codebase grows. Consider adding:
- Dependency management (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml)
- Testing framework setup
- Code formatting and linting tools
- Development server configuration
- Database setup and migration commands

## Virtual Environment

The project includes a Python 3.13 virtual environment in the `venv/` directory. Always activate this environment before development work.
